# LLMs and ChatGPT

## What is an LLM?
A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of AI system trained to understand and generate human-like text. It works by predicting what comes next in a sentence given the context. This makes LLMs great for answering questions, and generating stories and even code.

## How do LLMs work?
LLMs are trained on a large amount of text data (books, articles, tweets, you name it). During training, it learns patterns, relationships and context in language. For example, it learns that Paris is often associated with France (if you gave the text "The capital of France is" to the model, it would likely predict "Paris" as the next word). The model will also learn certain grammar rules, like adjectives come before nouns. This allows the generated text result to look like a human wrote it.

## What is ChatGPT?
ChatGPT is an LLM under the hood. The LLM used for ChatGPT is trained specifically to predict the next token given a conversation. It is really just a chat window that allows you to query the this LLM and get next word predictions.
