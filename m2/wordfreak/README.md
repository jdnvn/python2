# WordFreak

Write a Python program that counts the frequency of each word in a text file and prints the result to the console.

First, you will need a text file. You can find any one you would like on the internet or use [this one](https://cdn.serc.carleton.edu/files/teaching_computation/workshop_2018/activities/plain_text_version_declaration_inde.txt), which is the content of the Declaration of Independence.

You may either
1. use the `requests` library to get the contents
2. download the file to your computer and read it into the program

For extra credit, try to implement this with a Python class!
